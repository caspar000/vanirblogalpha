In Norse mythology, the Vanir (/ˈvɑːnɪər/;[1] singular Vanr) are a group of gods associated with health, fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future. The Vanir are one of two groups of gods (the other being the Æsir) and are the namesake of the location Vanaheimr (Old Norse "Home of the Vanir"). After the Æsir–Vanir War, the Vanir became a subgroup of the Æsir. Subsequently, members of the Vanir are sometimes also referred to as members of the Æsir. 
<br></br>
The Vanir are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. The Vanir are attested only in these Old Norse sources.

All the sources describe Njörðr and his children, Freyr and Freyja, as members of the Vanir. A euhemerized prose account in Heimskringla adds that Njörðr's sister—whose name is not provided—and Kvasir were also Vanir. In addition, Heimskringla reports a tale involving King Sveigðir's visit to Vanaheimr, where he meets a woman named Vana and the two produce a child named Vanlandi (whose name means "Man from the Land of the Vanir"). 
<br></br>
While not attested as Vanir, the gods Heimdallr and Ullr have been theorized as potential members of the group.

In the Prose Edda, a name listed for boars may be translated as "Van-child".

Scholars have theorized that the Vanir may be connected to small pieces of gold foil found in Scandinavia at some building sites from the Migration Period to the Viking Age and occasionally in graves. They have speculated whether the Vanir originally represented pre-Indo-European deities or Indo-European fertility gods, and have theorized a form of the gods venerated by the pagan Anglo-Saxons.
